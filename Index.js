<h2> About Me</h2>
<p>My full name is Dayjean Lee Sun Green I was born in 2003, on June 20th. I graduated highschool in 2021 and started my college career studying Automotive. I recently changed what I was studying to a more technological based program since I love Technology. I am now studying Software Developement and have started a few classes for the basics of coding.

    <h2>My Life Growing Up</h2>
      <p>My family and I are originally from Flint, Michigan. We moved to Pheonix, Arizona in 2008 and lived there for about half a year. It sucked as a kid since I started school in an Unfamiliar area but life was good. The biggest Event that happened in Pheonix was us visiting the Grand Canyon National park. Shortly after that we ended up moving to Concord, North Carolina. We live in Concord for about 7 years it was hard inetionally moving to a different area and making new freinds but we managed. The crime in the area started to rise rapidaly and eventaully our neighborhood wasnt safe anymore. So we moved to Charlotte North Carolina and have been here ever since.
